# CSC212-T3-ArmAssembly

Overview:

This project is part of the CSC212-T3 module and focuses on understanding and implementing Arm Assembly programming using the CPulator simulator. The practical provides hands-on experience in low-level programming, exploring the fundamental concepts of assembly language and the inner workings of computer systems at the hardware level.

Project Objectives:

Develop proficiency in Arm Assembly programming.
Gain a deeper understanding of how assembly language interfaces with hardware.
Explore low-level operations such as data manipulation, branching, and function calls.
Utilize CPulator to simulate and test assembly code in a controlled environment.

Tools and Resources:

CPulator: A web-based simulator for running and debugging Arm Assembly code.
Arm Assembly Language: The programming language used for this practical, focusing on the ARM architecture.
Reference Materials: Official ARM documentation, lecture notes, and additional resources provided by the CSC212-T3 module.

Setup and Usage:

Getting Started:
Access CPulator: Go to the CPulator website and open the ARMv7 simulator.
Write Your Code: Use the CPulator editor to write your Arm Assembly code. You can start with basic operations and progressively move to more complex tasks.
Run the Code: Use CPulator's run functionality to execute your code and observe the outputs.
Debugging: Utilize the debugging tools provided by CPulator to step through your code, monitor registers, and understand the behavior of your assembly program.
